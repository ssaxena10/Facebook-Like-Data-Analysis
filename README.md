# Facebook-Like-Data-Analysis

Online Social Network Analysis - CS 579

This project implements community detection and link prediction algorithms using Facebook “Like” data. The file “edges.txt.gz” shows like relationships between Facebook users. This was collected using snowball sampling: beginning with the user “Bill Gates”, found all the people he likes and then for each newly discovered user, find all the people they liked.
